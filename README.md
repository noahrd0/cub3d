# Cub3D

Welcome to Cub3D, a project inspired by the famous game Wolfenstein 3D. The goal of this project is to create a simplified 3D game engine using the miniLibX graphics library, allowing us to generate a 3D environment and move a player inside it.

## Prerequisites

Before starting to work on this project, make sure you have installed the miniLibX graphics library. You can find installation instructions in the `minilibx` folder of this project.

## Compilation

To compile the project, run the following command:

```shell
make
```
or
```shell
make bonus
```

This will generate an executable named cub3d or cub3d_bonus

## Usage

To launch the game, use the following command:

```shell
./cub3d path/to/map.cub
```
or
```shell
./cub3d_bonus path/to/map.cub
```

## Controls

* W or Up arrow: Forward
* S or Down arrow: Backward
* A: Left
* D: Right
* Q or Left arrow: Turn left
* E or Rigth arrow: Turn right
* M: Map
* Esc: Quit
